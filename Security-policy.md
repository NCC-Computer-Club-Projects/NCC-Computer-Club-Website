# NCC Computer Club security policy

## Outline

The main point of this  is just so the website is secured and each vulnerability 
published is reported and situated as soon as possible. This is more so basic.

## Scope

The security policy applies to everyone who is contributing and anyone who is partaking in the
development of the website. It is your responsibility alongside others to make sure any codes used is safe and not exploitative. 

This will also apply to anyone who is helping out in the security side and vulnerability assessment. 
You may not do anything malicious or hostile towards the website.

## Tools

There are a wide variety of different tools you can try to utilize
the more common tool I'm sure most of you know is "snyx" 

## Incident reporting 

If for anyone reason you notice a vulnerabilitiy and you wish to secure it, publish a pull-request and it will be taken cared of.


Short notice: be aware this can be changed at anytime. Any suggestions or ideas are helpful.
